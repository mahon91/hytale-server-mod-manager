# Hytale Server Mod Manager

This project is a lightweight administrative helper intended for private Hytale game servers.

## Purpose

The tool helps server administrators keep server-side mods up to date by querying available mod metadata from CurseForge and downloading updates when required.

It is designed exclusively for **private server administration** and **low-volume API usage**.

## Scope and Limitations

- No client-side features
- No mod redistribution or re-hosting
- No public mod mirrors
- No monetization
- No competition with CurseForge or Overwolf services

Mods are downloaded directly from CurseForge endpoints and are used locally by the server administrator.

## Status

Early development / internal tooling.

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by CurseForge or Overwolf.
